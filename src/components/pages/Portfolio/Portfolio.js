                            We welcomed this project because of the vision behind it. It was a very interesting phase to
                            explore the challenges the shipping industry was facing and appropriate solutions.
                            After analyzing business needs, we decided to develop a website integrated with a blockchain
                            module to improve the traceability, security, and transparency of the network. Another reason to
                            integrate blockchain was the introduction of BTNT coins and tokens.  </p>
